GiantBomb-API-Parser-Grapher
============================

Script that grabs CPI/Inflation data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, API/Game platform data from Giantbomb.com, figures out the current price of each platform, then generates a plot/bar graph for the adjusted price data, and a CSV file to save for the adjusted price data.

NOTE: To run this program from the command line, run the following commands, replacing the API key and file paths as necessary:
